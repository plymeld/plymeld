# Changelog

What changed in plymeld, for people using it. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

Versions are `0.YYYYMMDD.N`: the release's date (UTC) as one number, and N counting the releases of that day
(`plymeld --version`). Changes collect under Unreleased; a release is a tag, and the change after it gives that
section the release's version and date.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `plymeld calibrate flow`: the flow ratio on a plate of its own, after the melt plate. A column per temperature, a
  square patch per flow ratio (`--flow-ratios`), each patch's ratio and each column's temperature printed on the plate;
  only the patches' top layer is laid at the column's temperature, after a wait.
- `plymeld calibrate melt values TEMP=FLOW...`: a read melt plate's results written into the config file that defines
  the filament, as its maximum flow on the machine: a formula through every reading, straight between neighboring
  temperatures and flat past the ends, with the readings in the comment above it. The change is printed and checked
  first, `--dry-run` writes nothing, and `plymeld journal --undo` takes it back.

### Changed

- Every move's flow keeps a buffer below the filament's maximum flow: `plan.mechanism.motion.melt.buffer`, 10 % by
  default (moves capped at 90 % of `melt.flow.max`), 0 % for none. Moves the melt rate limits print 10 % slower; the
  melt plate's rows, which probe the limit itself, are not held to it.
- `plymeld calibrate melt` prints a table: a column per temperature (10 °C apart by default), a row per flow from half
  the filament's expected maximum flow to twice it (`--flow-step`), each row's flow and each column's temperature
  printed on the plate. Its base prints at the filament's own temperatures; the columns are waited for one by one.
- The filament plate no longer has flow-ratio patches (`--tests flow`, `--flow-ratios`): the flow plate measures the flow
  ratio before the plates that depend on it.

### Fixed

- The filament plate's recommendation named the key to enter a measured melt rate under as `melt.flow.maxw`; it is
  `melt.flow.max`.
- `plymeld init` drew its choice lists blank in a terminal that reports no width (a pseudo-terminal whose size was
  never set); it now draws them 80 columns wide there.
- `plymeld init` said Esc stops it; Esc does nothing in its lists and prompts. It now says Ctrl+C, which stops it at
  any question with nothing written.
- `plymeld init --folder DIR` ended by saying no `-cf` is needed; that is so only for plymeld's own config folder. For
  another folder it now says to pass the files with `-cf 'DIR/*.toml'`.

## [0.20261104.2] - 2026-11-04

### Added

- `plymeld printer send --print --level` asks the printer to level the bed before it prints, where its API takes that
  request (a Flashforge printer); `connection.start.level = true` on a machine makes it that machine's default, and
  `--no-level` prints without. A printer that levels from g-code instead (a Klipper printer, over Moonraker) refuses it
  before anything is sent.

## [0.20261104.1] - 2026-11-04

### Changed

- `plymeld init` sets up a Flashforge Creator 5 with Flashforge's own start sequence (the first tool selected and
  heated, the fans off) and an end that lifts clear of the print and switches every tool's heater off; a print speed of
  300 mm/s and a travel speed of 600 mm/s (the maker's figures); `M25` to pause; the 140x110 preview its screen shows;
  a nozzle limit of 320 C; and the shape of its heads.
- For any printer without its own start and end, `plymeld init`'s start now selects the print's first tool and
  heats that one (on a printer that selects tools by `T`), and its end lifts the head 10 mm clear of the print,
  within the build height, and turns the fans off.
- `plymeld init` offers travel at the printer's top speed rather than its print speed, and asks for its pause
  command, its preview pictures and each nozzle's top temperature where the printer's model names them.

### Fixed

- `plymeld slice` no longer calls a machine's `motion.acceleration.max` unused: the print and travel accelerations
  `plymeld init` writes are formulas of it.

## [0.20261104.0] - 2026-11-04

The first public release. [README.md](README.md) says what plymeld does and [FEATURES.md](FEATURES.md) lists it feature by
feature. In short:

- **Plans each print**: the pose on the bed, layer heights, the technique for each region, support, and the order of
  objects, weighed against your priorities (quality, accuracy, speed, material, strength, and reliability);
  `--explain` shows the facts, the alternatives, and why each lost.
- **Every value is a setting** with its source, bundled printer and filament values included; lock any decision and
  the rest is planned around it.
- **Slices to Klipper g-code** and checks the result against the machine and the model before you print.
- **Calibration plates** for melt, motion, filament, first layer, ironing, and seams, whose readings go back in as your
  filament's and machine's values.
- **Talks to printers** over Flashforge's LAN API and Moonraker: status, camera, files, send, pause, resume, cancel,
  and the loaded filaments compared with your config (`loadout -o` writes what the printer has, empty tools included,
  as a config file). Credentials stay out of config files: `plymeld printer credential` sets one in a secrets file,
  never from the command line.
- **A desktop window** beside the command line: a Windows installer (or portable zip) and a Linux AppImage, with the
  command line for Linux as its own download.
