# Decisions

Decisions about plymeld's design, from the first public release on, newest last. A decision is changed only by a new
entry that says which one it replaces.

The reasoning behind what plymeld already is lives with the code it explains. This file records what is decided from
here on.

Each entry:

```
## <number>. <the decision, in one line> (<date>)

**Context.** What prompted it.
**Decision.** What was decided.
**Rejected.** The alternatives, and why each lost.
**Consequences.** What changes, and what it costs.

## 1. A calibration plate's temperatures print coolest first side by side, hottest first stacked (2026-11-05)

**Context.** Plates that test several nozzle temperatures (the melt plate's columns, the first-layer plate's blocks, the
filament plate's bands) each chose their own order. A new plate needs a rule, with its reason, to choose by.

**Decision.** Where the temperatures stand side by side (columns, blocks), they print coolest first, with a wait (M109)
before each. A hotend heats under power but mostly cools on its own, so cooling is the slow direction. The nozzle has to
reach the coolest temperature from the one the plate's base prints at in any order, and coolest first makes that the only
cool-down. Where they are stacked (a tower of bands), they print hottest first. A band that fails (the extruder driven
past what the filament melts, most likely at the coldest temperatures) spoils everything above it, so the riskiest bands
go last, where a failure spoils only what remains.

**Rejected.** Hottest first side by side: it starts nearer a hot base's temperature, but every step after that is a
cool-down, so the plate cools from the hottest temperature to the coolest instead of from the base's temperature. Coolest
first in a tower: a failed cold band at the bottom ruins the whole tower.

**Consequences.** The melt and first-layer plates print coolest first and the filament plate's tower hottest first, as
before. A flat plate that replaces a tower, such as a flow-ratio plate split off the filament plate, prints coolest
first.
