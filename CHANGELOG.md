# Changelog

What changed in plymeld, for people using it. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

Versions are `0.YYYYMMDD.N`: the release's date (UTC) as one number, and N counting the releases of that day
(`plymeld --version`). Changes collect under Unreleased; a release is a tag, and the change after it gives that
section the release's version and date.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.20261104.0] - 2026-11-04

The first public release. [README.md](README.md) says what plymeld does and [FEATURES.md](FEATURES.md) lists it feature by
feature. In short:

- **Plans each print**: the pose on the bed, layer heights, the technique for each region, support, and the order of
  objects, weighed against your priorities (quality, accuracy, speed, material, strength, and reliability);
  `--explain` shows the facts, the alternatives, and why each lost.
- **Every value is a setting** with its source, bundled printer and filament values included; lock any decision and
  the rest is planned around it.
- **Slices to Klipper g-code** and checks the result against the machine and the model before you print.
- **Calibration plates** for melt, motion, filament, first layer, ironing, and seams, whose readings go back in as your
  filament's and machine's values.
- **Talks to printers** over Flashforge's LAN API and Moonraker: status, camera, files, send, pause, resume, cancel,
  and the loaded filaments compared with your config (`loadout -o` writes what the printer has, empty tools included,
  as a config file). Credentials stay out of config files: `plymeld printer credential` sets one in a secrets file,
  never from the command line.
- **A desktop window** beside the command line: a Windows installer (or portable zip) and a Linux AppImage, with the
  command line for Linux as its own download.
